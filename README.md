# Simulated Research Demos
Demonstration code from pre-published (or otherwise unpublished) research projects I have been involved with. Intended to showcase some of the coding methods used by the project without publicly releasing data or results. Pre-processing data formats will not be shared unless they are sourced from publicly available data. While example data used closely resembles the true data used by the project, **it is entirely simulated**.
